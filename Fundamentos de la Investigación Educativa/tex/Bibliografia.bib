	abstract = { Project-based learning and interdisciplinary projects present an opportunity for students to learn both technical skills and other skills which are relevant to their workplace success.  This paper presents an assessment of the educational impact of the OpenOrbiter program, a student-run, interdisciplinary CubeSat (a type of small satellite with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10cm and a mass of 1.33 kg) development program at the University of North Dakota, on participants with a major in computer science.  The value of the program to participants is assessed in terms of key metrics through a comparison of their pre-participation and present-day levels.  Particular focus is paid to identifying and quantifying the benefit of the program to students with a computer science major.  The educational value of the program to computer science students is compared and contrasted to the value to students of other majors.  The impact is assessed relative to their type of participation... },
