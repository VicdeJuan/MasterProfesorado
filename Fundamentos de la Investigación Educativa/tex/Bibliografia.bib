	abstract = { This text discusses the relationship between leisure and education in contemporary society from the perspective of day-to-day use of videogames by young people and its relationship to learning, and specifically school learning. We intend to analyze, in the light of current academic production, the following question: what possible relations are there between leisure (especially that related to uses and applications of videogames) and learning, from the perspective of school knowledge? We have made a brief state-of-the-art analysis of the productions related to this theme for the purpose of contributing to discussions that have taken root in its respect.  We know they are still in the beginning stage, in spite of the considerable increase of productions in the area, and that they constitute a controversial field in the context of the school. },
